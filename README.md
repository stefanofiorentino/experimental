# Light Management Desing (Patterns)

This is a test-driven development experiment for Light Management. The light managament topic has randomly been choosen among others.

The goal is to have a single collection of light objects using  them polymorphically at runtime. 

A second goal is to give the ability to the users of the lib to extend the kind of managed objects.

A third goad is the ability to serialize the content of the collection to be able to dump it to a storage location.
